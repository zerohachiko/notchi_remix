# Notchi 1.0.2

A focused patch release for notch alignment and visual fit on different MacBook displays.

## Notch Fit and Alignment

The collapsed notch now uses the system display's own notch curve when macOS provides it, instead of relying only on the handmade fallback shape.

- Better visual match to the real notch on supported MacBooks
- Better alignment across MacBook Air and MacBook Pro displays
- More robust notch sizing based on live screen geometry instead of a fixed fudge factor
- Reduced clipping and bottom-gap issues in the collapsed notch

## Update Delivery

The website and update metadata pipeline were tightened up to make releases load more cleanly.

- Hosted markdown release notes are now served directly for each version
- The website now derives download/version metadata from the appcast at build time
- In-app update flows should show more consistent release information

## Internal Cleanup

- Small internal cleanup to the Anthropic usage service error types
